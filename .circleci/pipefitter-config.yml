# This file is not in use. This project does not use pipefitter
# in circleci, but this was used to locally generate the .circelci/config.yml
# in this directory.
#
# Further modifications were performed after generating the config:
# - removed references to aws-ssm
# - removed configs related to next-bundle and bundler checksums not relevant to this project
# - added the `cloudinary` context so it can run integration tests against real cloudinary
# - using a newer version of the circleci/browser-tools orb
